# UNET-Model-on-Dubai-Images
The files include code for a U-NET convolutional Model for satellite image classification.

There are total of 6 classes viz building, land, road, veg, water and unlabeled. The model uses the UNET convolutional model which can be found here https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597.
